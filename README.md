# df_file_transfer_script
A bash script to transfer files and settings from one version of Dwarf Fortress to another.  This script was written prior to the new Steam version (50.X) so is probably only valid through version 47.05.  I have not tested it against newer versions and was planning a new version of the script for the newer versions.
